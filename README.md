Open-Source COVID-19 GPS Tracker, Symptoms Logger, Transit Input, Cough Analysis, Supplies &amp; Testing + Waiting Time.
Go to the AmericanaEuropa-SafeGuardAPK branch for the installable Android app package.
The Cough Analysis cannot yet diagnose as voice samples and log correlation is required on a large scale to train an engine.
Waiting Times have not been integrated since it requires mass adoption with location sharing as a prerequisite.
